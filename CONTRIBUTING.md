## üõ°Ô∏è **Development Guidelines**

### **The Care Test**

**Every feature must pass this test:**

```python
def care_test(feature):
    """Every feature must pass the care test"""
    
    # Primary questions
    if feature.potential_harm > feature.user_benefit:
        return "Do not implement"
    
    if not feature.allows_user_consent():
        return "Redesign for user agency"
    
    if not feature.is_transparent_and_explainable():
        return "Add transparency layers"
    
    if feature.could_be_used_for_manipulation():
        return "Add safeguards or redesign"
    
    # Cultural sensitivity check
    if not feature.respects_cultural_contexts():
        return "Add cultural adaptation"
    
    # Privacy protection check
    if not feature.protects_privacy():
        return "Enhance privacy protections"
    
    return "Proceed with care"
```

### **Code Review Checklist**

**Before submitting any PR, ensure:**

- [ ] **User Agency:** Does this respect user choice and autonomy?
- [ ] **Transparency:** Is it clear what this does and why?
- [ ] **Privacy:** Does this protect sensitive data?
- [ ] **Safety:** Could this be used to manipulate or harm?
- [ ] **Human Support:** Is there a clear path to human help when needed?
- [ ] **Cultural Sensitivity:** Have we considered diverse cultural contexts?
- [ ] **Trauma-Informed:** Does this follow trauma-informed principles?
- [ ] **Accessibility:** Is this accessible to users with disabilities?
- [ ] **Testing:** Are there tests for healing outcomes, not just functionality?

### **Coding Standards**

**Python Code Style:**
```python
# All code should prioritize human wellbeing
class CareFeature:
    """
    Every class should have a clear caring purpose.
    
    Principles:
    - User wellbeing over system efficiency
    - Transparency over clever algorithms
    - Cultural sensitivity over one-size-fits-all
    - Privacy protection over data collection
    """
    
    def __init__(self, user_consent_required=True):
        self.user_consent_required = user_consent_required
        self.cultural_adaptations = []
        self.privacy_protections = []
        self.trauma_informed = True
    
    def process_with_care(self, user_data, cultural_context):
        """Always process data with care and respect"""
        if not self.has_user_consent(user_data):
            raise ConsentRequiredError("User consent required")
        
        if not self.is_culturally_appropriate(cultural_context):
            self.adapt_for_culture(cultural_context)
        
        return self.gentle_processing(user_data)
```

**Documentation Requirements:**
- All functions must explain their caring purpose
- Include cultural considerations
- Document privacy implications
- Explain trauma-informed design choices
- Provide examples of ethical usage

## üîç **Testing Guidelines**

### **Healing-Focused Testing**

**Test for care outcomes, not just functionality:**

```python
import pytest
from heart_protocol.tests.healing_focused_testing import HealingAssertions

class TestCareFeature:
    """Test with the same care we give - thorough, gentle, healing-focused"""
    
    def test_healing_effectiveness(self, care_feature, user_scenario):
        """Test that feature actually helps users heal"""
        before_wellbeing = user_scenario.wellbeing_score
        
        result = care_feature.provide_care(user_scenario)
        
        after_wellbeing = user_scenario.updated_wellbeing_score
        
        # Use healing-focused assertions
        HealingAssertions.assert_healing_progress(
            before_wellbeing, after_wellbeing, minimum_improvement=5.0
        )
        HealingAssertions.assert_trauma_safety(result)
        HealingAssertions.assert_cultural_sensitivity(result, user_scenario.cultural_context)
    
    def test_crisis_intervention_safety(self, crisis_scenario):
        """Test crisis intervention with safety priority"""
        response = care_feature.handle_crisis(crisis_scenario)
        
        assert response.human_support_activated
        assert response.immediate_safety_resources_provided
        assert response.follow_up_scheduled
        assert not response.could_cause_retraumatization
```

### **Cultural Sensitivity Testing**

```python
@pytest.mark.cultural_sensitive
def test_cultural_adaptation(care_feature, cultural_contexts):
    """Test adaptation across different cultural contexts"""
    for context in cultural_contexts:
        adapted_response = care_feature.adapt_for_culture(context)
        
        assert adapted_response.culturally_appropriate
        assert adapted_response.respects_cultural_values
        assert adapted_response.uses_appropriate_language
        assert not adapted_response.contains_cultural_assumptions
```

---

## üåç **Internationalization**

### **Adding Language Support**

```bash
# Add a new language
python scripts/add_language.py --language es --name "Spanish"

# Update translations
python scripts/update_translations.py

# Test cultural adaptations
pytest tests/cultural_sensitivity_tests.py::test_spanish_adaptation
```

### **Cultural Adaptation Guidelines**

```python
class CulturalAdaptationGuidelines:
    """Guidelines for cultural sensitivity in code"""
    
    COLLECTIVIST_CULTURES = {
        'communication_style': 'high_context',
        'decision_making': 'consensus_based',
        'family_involvement': 'high',
        'authority_respect': 'high'
    }
    
    INDIVIDUALIST_CULTURES = {
        'communication_style': 'low_context',
        'decision_making': 'individual_choice',
        'family_involvement': 'low_to_medium',
        'authority_respect': 'medium'
    }
    
    def adapt_care_approach(self, user_culture, care_content):
        """Adapt care approach based on cultural context"""
        if user_culture in self.COLLECTIVIST_CULTURES:
            return self.adapt_for_collectivist(care_content)
        else:
            return self.adapt_for_individualist(care_content)
```

        self.ensure_emotional_safety(conflict.participants)
        
        # Step 2: Understand needs and concerns
        needs = self.understand_underlying_needs(conflict)
        
        # Step 3: Find healing-focused solutions
        solutions = self.generate_caring_solutions(needs)
        
        # Step 4: Implement with community support
        return self.implement_with_care(solutions)
```
