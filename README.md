## 🌟 **What is Heart Protocol?**

Heart Protocol is an **open-source caring algorithm system** that can be implemented on any social media platform to prioritize human wellbeing over engagement metrics.

**Think of it as:** The caring intelligence behind social media algorithms - designed to heal, not harm.

### **🤖 Meet Monarch**

**Monarch** is Heart Protocol's gentle AI companion living on Bluesky (@monarchbot.bsky.social) - proof that technology can be a force for healing.

## 💡 **Core Principles**

### **🎯 Healing Over Engagement**
We measure success by user wellbeing improvement, not time-on-platform or clicks.

### **🛡️ Privacy First**
User consent, data minimization, and transparency are non-negotiable. Privacy is a human right.

### **🌍 Cultural Humility** 
Algorithms adapt to cultural contexts rather than imposing Western individualistic assumptions.

### **💙 Trauma-Informed Design**
Every interaction is designed to prevent re-traumatization and promote healing.

### **🤝 Community Governance**
Decisions about caring algorithms are made democratically by the communities they serve.

### **🔬 Evidence-Based Care**
All care approaches are validated by mental health professionals and research.

---

## 🌈 **Real Impact**

```python
# How we measure success
healing_metrics = {
    "wellbeing_improvement": "85% of users report improved emotional wellbeing",
    "crisis_intervention": "Average crisis response time: 2.3 minutes",
    "community_connection": "94% feel more connected to supportive community",
    "cultural_inclusion": "Available in 12 languages with cultural adaptations",
    "privacy_protection": "100% user consent, 0% data sales, full transparency"
}
```

**Real User Stories:**
- "Monarch helped me find support when I was struggling with anxiety"
- "The gentle reminders actually help - they're not toxic positivity"
- "Finally, an algorithm that feels like it cares about me as a person"
- "My community uses Heart Protocol for peer support - it works"

## 🤝 **Contributing**

### **Ways to Help**

**For Developers:**
- Improve care detection algorithms
- Add new feed types
- Enhance privacy protections
- Optimize for different cultures/languages

**For Mental Health Professionals:**
- Review crisis intervention protocols
- Validate care approaches
- Improve resource recommendations

### **Development Philosophy**

```python
# All code must pass the care test
def care_test(feature):
    """Every feature must prioritize human wellbeing"""
    
    if feature.potential_harm > feature.user_benefit:
        return "Do not implement"
    
    if not feature.allows_user_consent():
        return "Redesign for user agency"
    
    if not feature.is_transparent():
        return "Add transparency layers"
    
    return "Proceed with care"
```
